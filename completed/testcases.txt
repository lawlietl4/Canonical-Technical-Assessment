Testing SSH using password and key:
1. install selected OS onto machine (VM or metal)
2. install necessary SSH server and/or client software
3. from client system attempt to ssh into machine with known username and password
	a. if username was set improperly then physical access and/or reimaging will be necessary
	b. if password fails to authenticate properly, retype slowly
		i. if this continues to fail physical access and/or reimaging will be necessary
	c. fails if either is not properly set and OS needs to be reimaged
4. create a key-value pair on the server machine using [ ssh-keygen [-t [ecdsa|ecdsa_sk] | [ed22519|ed25519_sk] | rsa | dsa ] ]
5. answer all prompts provided by the application and supply the proper password
6. copy the public key to the client system using [ssh-copy-id user@client-ip] and test to see if prompted for password attached to key
	a. if password does not work then administrator will have to regenerate the key
	b. this fails if password is not set properly and key file cannot be regenerated
